### About

frab is a web-based conference planning and management system. It helps
to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers and to create a
schedule.

frab is based upon [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) . It was
created to organize [FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.org) , where it
replaced [pentabarf](http://pentabarf.org) as the primary conference
planning tool.

### Features

is capable of:
