      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        frab is a web-based conference planning and management system.
        It helps to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers
        and to create a schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        frab is based upon
        <a href='http://www.rubyonrails.org'>Ruby on Rails</a>
        . It was created to organize
        <a href='http://www.froscon.org'>FrOSCon</a>
        , where it replaced
        <a href='http://pentabarf.org'>pentabarf</a>
        as the primary conference planning tool.

      <h3>Hosted frab with frabulous</h3>
      <p>
        I am currenty experimenting with a hosted version of frab,
        <a href='http://www.frabulous.net' title='frabulous conference planning and management software'>frabulous</a>
        . frabulous is currently in private beta. I am still looking for testers, so if you are interested, please sign up.
